=============
 DESCRIPTION 
=============

The Phorward Foundation Toolkit is a package consisting of a powerful C
functions library, also called Phorward Foundation Library (libphorward), and
some console-based scripts and programs.

The toolkit can be used for enhanced, general-purpose software development in C.
The library provides many useful and extending features to C applications,
including

- Standard data structures: Linked lists, hash tables, dynamic stacks, bitsets
- Extending string functions for dynamic string management
- Functions to work with sets (set theory functions)
- A full-fledged regular expression parser, engine and management tools
- Platform-independent, system-specific functions
- XML-parser (DOM) and management tools
- Variant data type structure to work with arbitrary values in one object
- Consistent Unicode and UTF-8 support
- Object-oriented fashion of some function interfaces (e.g. regular expressions)

Furthermore, the package provides

- min_lalr1, an experimental LALR(1) parser generator (used to bootstrap UniCC)
- pdoc, a source-code to documentation generator
- pproto, a C-functions prototype generator
- Several scripts for quick source code maintenance

Toolkit.


==============
 INSTALLATION 
==============

Installation of the Phorward Foundation Toolkit is simple as every GNU-style
open source program. Extract the release tarball or clone the Mercurial
repository into a directory of your choice.

Then, run

  ./configure

to configure the build-system and generate the Makefiles.
Type

  make

and

  make install

(properly as root) then, to install the toolkit into your system.

On Windows systems, the usage of Cygwin or another Unix shell environment is
required.
