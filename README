WHAT ARE THE PHORWARD FOUNDATION LIBRARIES?
*******************************************
Welcome to the Phorward Foundation Libraries & SDK!

This software package unions a set of universal C libraries, utility programs
and shell scripts into a platform-independent development environment for C
programs. The initial purpose of this project is that it serves as a build-
environment and toolkit library for various software projects which have
their origin at Phorward Software Technologies.

Phorward Software Technologies is a company from Dortmund in Germany, which
is specialized in the area of compiler construction, scripting languages and
other kinds of software development tools.

This toolchain can possibly also be used for any other kind of software
projects, so this is also the reason why it was released under the BSD
open source license agreements.

Especially the platform-independent approach as well as many of the useful
tools, libraries and functions provided by the Phorward Foundation Libraries
and Software Development Kit make the entire package suitable for many
C programmers.

Below is what the Phorward Foundation Libraries & SDK provide. Please note,
that all libraries and tools are under recent development within the Phorward
software projects, so they will always be extended and enhanced from time to
time.

+ pbasis		The Phorward Basis Library
				A basic function library providing a bunch of useful,
				dynamic utilites. This includes functions for linked
				lists, hash-tables, stacks, multi-byte and wide-char-
				acter strings, character-class handling (sets of values),
				trace tools, a dynamic variant data type, XML-DOM pro-
				cessing functions, conversion functions and some utility
				and system functions.

+ pregex		The Phorward Regular Expression Library
				An implementation of a Unicode-enabled regular expression
				library for C programs. This includes a build-in regular
				expression parser, NFA construction and definition, (DFA)
				subset construction and minimization, functions for string
				matching, splitting and replacing using regular expressions,
				and much more.

+ pstring		The Phorward String Object Library
				A unicode-enabled, dynamic string object to be used within
				C programs. This library is still under development, and
				should be used with care.

+ min_lalr1		Minimalist LALR(1) Parser Generator
				An simple, quick&dirty-written parser generator to build
				simple LALR(1) parsers. This project served as an experi-
				mental and research compiler for the upcoming UniCC parser
				generator project developed by Phorward Software Technologies,
				which is entirely integrated into the Foundation Libaries.
			
+ DEMO			A project with useful demonstration examples on how to use the
				Phorward Foundation Libraries.

+ NEWPROJECT	A project template that is compileable and serves a skeleton
				for new programs. Copy this directory within $PHOME/src to
				start a new project hosted and served by the Phorward
				Foundation Libraries and SDK.

These are some of the tools you get:

+ mkdoc			Phorward Source-Code Documentation Generator
				An AWK-script to construct manuals from source codes
				(by validating comments)

+ mkproto		Phorward Function Prototype Generator
				A shell-script to generate C-function prototypes from source
				code; Requires a C-compiler as preprocessor.

+ ppp,			Various utility programs used within Makefiles and other
  lincl,		scripts to process files and get the build-environment run.
  dmake,
  psh,
  text_to_c

*******************
DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
*******************
The Phorward Foundation Libraries SDK holds a simple directory structure,
which can quickly be accessed.

	run/		The 'run'-directory holds executables and scripts that are
				necessary for the further build-processes. Some build-steps
				do even place tools there to access them in later stages.
	src/		The source-directory contains sub-folders, each one for a
				program or library which is compiled within the Phorward
				Foundation Libraries SDK. Place your own projects even here if
				you want to develop them within the Phorward tool environment.
	include/	Holds include-files of libraries.
	lib/		The library archives (under Linux/Unix .a-files, under Windows
				.lib-files) are placed here.
	doc/		The document folder. Documentation generated from source using
				mkdoc is placed here.
	tpl/		The template directory holds several template files needed by
				different tools.
	etc/		The etc-folder is used for several files. Its existence is not
				required.

The development environment will install aliases within your session to access
every directory from anywhere just by enterng the first character of the
folder you want to change to. Type 's' to switch to $PHOME/src, or 'r' to
enter the $PHOME/run directory.

$PHOME will always contain the path to the Phorward Foundation Libraries root.
Say 'phelp' to quickly get a short help on all aliases.

*******************
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
*******************
To get the Phorward Foundation Libraries compiled and run, you need either a
Linux/Unix system, in combination with gcc, or a Windows-system with a
Unix-like script execution environment, e.g. Minimal System (MSYS), and a
compiler like MinGW or even Microsoft Visual C++ (Express Edition).

Phorward Foundation Libraries compile both with GNU gcc and Microsoft Visual
C++ 2005 (or higher), command-line compiler. Other compilers are currently
not supported, but by changing the settings in $PHOME/include/Make.inc, you
will properly be able to change them.

If you want to compile under Windows, make sure the vcvarsall.bat environment
setup script of Visual C++ was run first before you go into your MSYS
enironment.

*********************
INSTALLATION / UPDATE
*********************
To install the Phorward Foundation Libraries, extract the whole package into
one folder of your choice. If you already run a Phorward Foundation Library
installation and want to upgrade it, choose the same way - your own projects
are not affected during the installation.

Then, sh into the installation base directory and run

	. run/psetup

which runs a simple installation script. Answer the questions in the script.
After this has finished, the Foundation Libraries are ready to run.

******************
GET THE SDK TO RUN
******************
Whenever you want to compile something within the Phorward Foundation
Libraries, you first have to run

	. ./psh

to set up your environment. This will run the environment setup script, and
installs some aliases and environment variables which are necessary to run
the SDK.

*****************************
COMPILING THE LIBRARIES/TOOLS
*****************************
After you ran the 'psh' environment setup script, you're ready to compile the
libraries:

	s
	makeall

*************
DEMO PROGRAMS
*************
Please take a look at the commented demonstration programs you can find in
$PHOME/src/DEMO.



OK. That's it right now! There will soon be made more help available!
If you have any questions, ideas or critics, don't miss to drop a mail!

Have fun!
