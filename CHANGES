[+] DEMO:
	Extended demo project to new pbasis-library features
[+]	pbasis/xml:
	Extended XML-processing functions: xml_count(), xml_count_all(),
	xml_set_float_attr(), xml_get_float_attr(), xml_set_int_attr(),
	xml_get_int_attr()
[-]	pbasis/xml:
	Removed substitution and memory allocation bugs
[+]	pbasis/xml:
	Rewritten output of XML-functions
[+]	pbasis/xml:

	single- and multi-byte-character strings.
[+] pbasis/string:
	Added new functions pvasprintf(), pasprintf(), Pvasprintf() and Pasprintf()[[+] pbasis/var:
	Added a function generator and several utility functions to build-up a
	variant data type with automatic type conversion into the Phorward
	Foundation Libraries; This datatype can hold byte, char, integer, long,
	unsinged integer, float, double as well as string and wide-character string
	values in one structure. Check out the sources at pbasis/var.*. The get,
	set and conv-functions of the pvar-variant datatype are generated by an
	awk-script var.gen.awk with definitions from var.h
