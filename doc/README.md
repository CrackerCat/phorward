# doc

This directory hold the Phorward C/C++ Library's documentation.

Due to a personal favor, the whole documentation is written using the markup language [txt2tags](https://txt2tags.org/), which allows documentation conversion into formats like HTML, man page and LaTeX.

__Important note:__ All .t2t-files in this directory represent the documentation source files, except the file ``ref.t2t``. This file is constructed automatically by the ``run/pdoc`` utility from the C source files in ``src``. If changing this file is wanted, please change the particular locations in the C source code.
